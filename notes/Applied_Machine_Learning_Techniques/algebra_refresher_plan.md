# 📘 30-Day Algebra Refresher Plan

## 🔑 Goal
Rebuild comfort with algebra so you can easily understand regression formulas (R², Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net).

---

## Week 1 – The Basics (Days 1–7)
**Focus:** Get comfortable with numbers, operations, and equations again.

- **Day 1:** Order of operations (PEMDAS). Simplify expressions.  
- **Day 2:** Solving 1-step and 2-step equations.  
- **Day 3:** Solving multi-step equations.  
- **Day 4:** Inequalities (>, <, ≤, ≥) and absolute values (|x|).  
- **Day 5:** Intro to exponents & roots (square, cube, square roots).  
- **Day 6:** Combine like terms & distributive property.  
- **Day 7:** Practice set (mix of Days 1–6).  

📚 *Resources:*  
- [Khan Academy Algebra Basics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x54b8fbf3748909b0:foundations)  
- [CK-12 Algebra Intro](https://www.ck12.org/student/)

## Week 2 – Equations & Graphs (Days 8–14)
**Focus:** Linear equations, slope, and functions.

- **Day 8:** Graphing points (x, y).  
- **Day 9:** Slope of a line (rise/run).  
- **Day 10:** Slope-intercept form (y = mx + b).  
- **Day 11:** Graphing lines.  
- **Day 12:** Parallel & perpendicular lines.  
- **Day 13:** Functions (what they are, f(x) notation).  
- **Day 14:** Practice set.  

📚 *Resources:*  
- [Khan Academy: Linear Equations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x2f8bb11595b61c86:linear-equations-graphs)

## Week 3 – Polynomials & Quadratics (Days 15–21)
**Focus:** Build comfort with exponents & squares (needed for Ridge).

- **Day 15:** Adding & subtracting polynomials.  
- **Day 16:** Multiplying polynomials.  
- **Day 17:** Factoring basics.  
- **Day 18:** Quadratic equations (ax² + bx + c = 0).  
- **Day 19:** Solving quadratics by factoring.  
- **Day 20:** Solving quadratics by quadratic formula.  
- **Day 21:** Practice set.  

📚 *Resources:*  
- [Khan Academy: Quadratics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x2f8bb11595b61c86:quadratics)

## Week 4 – Advanced Prep for Regression (Days 22–30)
**Focus:** Summations, absolute values, and functions.

- **Day 22:** Review absolute values (|x|).  
- **Day 23:** Summation notation (Σ) → what it means.  
- **Day 24:** Practice Σ with simple sums (1+2+3+…+n).  
- **Day 25:** Intro to sequences & series.  
- **Day 26:** Work with inequalities again (helps for error terms).  
- **Day 27:** Systems of equations (multiple variables).  
- **Day 28:** Review of linear functions & graphing.  
- **Day 29:** Mixed practice: equations, exponents, summations.  
- **Day 30:** Final review quiz (self-test with Khan or CK-12).  

📚 *Resources:*  
- [Khan Academy: Sequences & Series](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x2f8bb11595b61c86:sequences)

## 🎯 How to Use This Plan
- Spend **20–30 minutes a day**.  
- Use **Khan Academy** for practice problems (auto-graded).  
- If stuck, use **Photomath app** to see step-by-step solutions.  
- At the end of each week → do a practice day (mix problems).
